Template to take notes, summarize class or scientific report. You can directly click on the button "Use this template" as it will create a repo.

This template is based from Thomas'Nifty Template on Typst's Discord server.
This is a template for Scientifique Report and class resume at ULB.

# Getting Started:

To use this template juste start with a `main.typ` file with this basic configuration:

```typst
#import "config.typ": *

#show: template

= Introduction <intro>
#lorem(50)


// #bibliography("./bibliography.bib")
```

**Before starting writing** take a look at the `config.typ` file to customize the front-page and boxes

If you want to split the document in multiple files you can use the `#include` directive in the `main.typ` file.

```typst
#include "introduction.typ"
```

and make sure to add the `#import "config.typ": *` in the new file.

## Boxes

There are two types of boxes. `popup` and `borderbox`. You can either use (or modify) the ones already
in `config.typ` or create new ones following the same pattern. Which means create adding an element in
`kinds`, `extra-pref` and `colorkind` arrays.

The boxes have multiple parameters:

- **kind**: The kinds which refers to the box. It will be used to track how many figure of this kind and update the counter
- **supplement** : The text displayed when you create a ref (using `@` )
- **icon**: The icon, emoji displayed (only in borderbox)
- **color**: The color of the box
- **breakable**: Wether the box should break and start on the following page if there is not enough place

You can use the boxes in the `config.typ` like this :

- popup

```typst
#definition[Title][Content][footer(optional)]<def:name0>
```

If you don't want any title, you can juste write `#definition[Content]<def:name1>`

- borderbox

```typst
#example[Title][Content]<ex:name3>
```

In a similar way you can forgot about the title just like this `#example[Content]`

You can make a reference to the boxes with `@def:name0` (wich is the label inside the `<>`)

If you want to change the parameters **on the fly** use

```typst
#warning(breakable: false, supplement: "Hey", color: brown, icon: emoji.face.cry)[This is a new Warning][Content]
```

# Issues:

- The captions of figures are not rendered inside a box.
- Tables of figures not working anymore

# TODO:

- Fix issues
- Remove i-figured dependency, maybe use rich-counter
- Maybe add equate library for maths equations
- Maybe add wrap-it library to easily wrap text around figures
- Make the box kinds state
- Make colorfull headings using colors, forms, special positions, fonts, etc...
- Make a better preface by adding colors, image of ulb's building
- Add preamble
- Make page numbers colorfulls (add forms, colors)
- Make better headers and footer, cleaner
- Add a way to rapidly create code, graphs, automaton
- clean code
- Make it a local package
- Add support for english (box, months, figures)
