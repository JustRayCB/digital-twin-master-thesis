    abstract = {We describe IoTCloud, a platform to connect smart devices to cloud services for real time data processing and control. A device connected to IoTCloud can communicate with real time data analysis frameworks deployed in the cloud via messaging. The platform design is scalable in connecting devices as well as transferring and processing data. With IoTCloud, a user can develop real time data processing algorithms in an abstract framework without concern for the underlying details of how the data is distributed and transferred. For this platform, we primarily consider real time robotics applications such as autonomous robot navigation, where there are strict requirements on processing latency and demand for scalable processing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, a robotic application is developed on top of the framework. The system and the robotics application characteristics are measured to show that data processing in central servers is feasible for real time sensor applications.},
