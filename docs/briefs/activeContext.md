# Active Context
**Branch:** preprocessing-module  
**Phase:** P1 ‚Äî Data Preprocessing & Quality  
**Window:** Oct‚ÄìDec 2025  

---

## üéØ Focus & Exit Criteria
**Focus:** Build a production-ready real-time preprocessing pipeline ensuring sensor data validity, integrity, and readiness for analytics.  
**Exit criteria (target Dec 2025):**
- Data validation gates (range, rate, stuck, flatline) ‚â• 99% pass rate
- DQ score and alerting active in dashboard
- Schema versioning and audit log stable
- Influx retention & rollups automated
- Basic alerting rules engine functional
- Action logging schema and API endpoints defined

---

## üß© Near-Term Tasks (This Sprint)
- [x] Define and implement sensor event schema
- [ ] Sensor data validation pipelines/rules (range, RoC, stuck or flatline, DQ scoring)
- [ ] Implement missing data handling (FFILL + capped interpolation) when readings are missing or dropped
- [ ] Noise filtering, integrate EWMA smoothing and optional Kalman filter  
- [ ] Finalize calibration tables and normalization logic  
- [ ] Rollups and retention policy for InfluxDB
- [ ] Setup of a non-TS database (Postgres) for audit logs and alert/action tracking
- [ ] Implement alert rules engine (thresholds, persistence, cooldown)  
- [ ] Finalize action/audit log schemas and migrations  
- [ ] Create API endpoints `/logs`, `/alerts`, `/actions`, `/configs`  
- [ ] Create a Minimal UI for logs and alerts to expose to users
- [ ] Run QA: synthetic replays, dropouts, noisy to see how the system copes and compute DQ score metrics

## üß† Changes Since Last Update
- Created Sensor validation config file (`dt/utils/preprocessing_config.yml`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks / Blockers
- **Spark load on Raspberry Pi** may exceed available RAM; considering external node for preprocessing.  
- **Sensor drift** (soil moisture) needs recalibration automation.  
- **Schema evolution** could break Kafka consumers if not versioned properly.  

---

## ü™Ñ Summary
The preprocessing-module branch now focuses on:
- Validation and normalization of sensor data  
- Quality flagging, DQ scoring, and audit visibility  
- Preparing alerting and action logging foundations  

By end of P1 (Dec 2025), data pipelines should be fully validated and alert-ready, setting up for control automation (P2).
