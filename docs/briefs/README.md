# ⚠️ WARNING

The documents in this folder were generated **with the assistance of a Large Language Model (ChatGPT)**.
They were **not created from scratch by the model** but were guided by my draft roadmap, codebase, and design ideas.
The model was used as a **productivity and clarity aid** — to refine language, structure plans, and correct misunderstandings.

All final decisions, interpretations, and directions remain my own.
These documents are **reference material**, not a strict, step-by-step roadmap.
They represent an **evolving guide** to where the project is heading, not an authoritative specification.
