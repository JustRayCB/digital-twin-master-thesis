# Progress — Week of 2025-10-08
**Branch:** preprocessing-module  
**Phase:** P1 (Preprocessing & Data Quality)

---

## ✅ Done
- Preprocessing validators for range, rate-of-change, and stuck detection covered by deterministic Spark tests.
- Data-quality scoring, imputation strategies (forward fill, window averaging, linear extrapolation guardrails), and smoothing hook integrated into the streaming pipeline.
- Structured streaming job publishes processed payloads with Kafka sink wiring and topic remapping utilities.
- Architecture operational end-to-end (Kafka → Preprocessing → InfluxDB → Flask).  
- Sensor drivers functional: DHT22, BH1750, soil moisture.  
- Dataclass schema (`SensorData`) finalized and versioning ready.  
- Storage in InfluxDB and accessible via Flask with API endpoints `/data/timestamp`, `data/id`, ...
- Kafka topics (`dt.sensors.*`) live and tested.  
- Flask dashboard streaming confirmed.  
- Docs & Setup: Poetry environment cleaned, Make targets added, Pi install tested.

| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Sensor Data Validation**     | Check ranges, RoC, stuck values and outliers; tag invalid data (DQ score).                  | ✅ Done         |
| **Calibration & Normalization** | Build calibration tables (dry/saturated soil baselines, per-sensor normalization to [0–1]).  | ⏳ To do        |
| **Missing Data Handling**       | Implement forward-fill and interpolation for short gaps; flag longer outages.                | ✅ Done         |
| **Alert Engine (v1)**           | Create rule-based system for threshold breaches with persistence window and cooldown.        | ⏳ To do        |
| **Audit & Action Store**        | Design SQLAlchemy models for `actions`, `alerts`, `configs`, `jobs`; add Alembic migrations. | ⏳ To do        |
| **Config Registry v0**          | Save and version user thresholds/schedules with rollback.                                    | ⏳ To do        |
| **REST API Extensions**         | Add `/alerts`, `/actions`, `/configs` endpoints and simple HTML tables in Flask.             | ⏳ To do        |
| **Testing & QA**                | Run synthetic data replays, chaos tests (dropouts/spikes), and compute Data Quality metrics. | ⏳ To do        |

## ⚠️ Issues / Risks
- **DHT22 instability** — occasional read failures.  
- **Spark load** — may exceed Pi limits; offload option considered.  
- **Incomplete topics** — alerts/actions/audit not yet connected.  
- **Testing coverage** — integration tests missing for Kafka → Influx → Dashboard.
