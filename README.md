# digital-twin-plant
This thesis will focus on the practical implementation of a Digital Twin integrated in the framework of Internet of Things to monitor the health of a plant, using various sensors as data collectors and a Raspberry Pi as a central device.

# TODO 
- Making Mock-up of Sensors
- Configuring the MQTT broker
- Make the sensor manager send the sensors data using MQTT
- Displaying the data received by MQTT on the web app
- Store the data in the database
> ⚠️ The dabase and the dashboard run indepently of the main digital twin code
